# Float Documentation



Design documentation for Float.

A *design system* collects reusable components to build an application, including why and how to use these components. It should be contained and managed independent from the application.

It should be *consistent, self-contained, reusable, and accessible.*

## Key Steps

### 1. Create *design language*

#### **Color**

- Color is used to convey...
  - Feedback: error and success states
  - Information: Charts, graphs, wayfinding elements
  - Hierarchy: Showing structured order through color and typography
- Include 1-3 primaries.

#### **Typography**

Use 2 fonts: 1 for headings and body copy, and a monospace font for code. (Size, leading, typefaces, etc.)

#### **Size and Space**

Use a 4-based scale to achieve rhythym and balance. (Margins, padding, positioning coordinates, border spacing)

#### **Imagery** 

Guidelines for illustrations and icons. (icons, illustrations)

### 2. Create *pattern library*

### 3. Document what each component *is* and *when to use* it.

### Test Design system

4 types of tests:

1. Unit testing: execute functions with a set of predefined inputs for JS functions.
2. Functional testing: tested by performing user actions
3. Visual Regression Testing: comparing the visual components after actions
4. Automated Accessibility Testing: ensure components are accessible
